Source: [Regex Engine (Python) - HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/114)

## Introduction

Learn about the syntax of regular expressions, practice working with the string type, parsing, and slicing, and get more familiar with boolean algebra and recursion.

Regular expressions are a fundamental part of computer science and natural language processing. In this project, you will write an extendable regex engine that can handle basic regex syntax, including literals (a, b, c, etc.), wild-cards (.), and metacharacters (?, *, +, ^, $).

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:
1. Implement a program that compares two single character strings (including the wildcard) and determines if there's a match.
2. Extend your engine to compare two equal length strings using recursion.
3. Add the ability to compare a regex to strings that vary in length.
4. Extend the engine to handle the operators ^ and $ that control the position of the regex within a string.
5. Support the additional operators ?, *, and + that control the repetition of a character within a string.
6. Finally, implement the backslash \ as an escape symbol that allows to use metacharacters as literals.

Other features will be comming soon!
